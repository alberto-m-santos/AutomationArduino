# Autonomous Systems - Arduino
## Objectives

- Build and Interpret models
- Finite State Machines, Grafcet
- Implement State Machines in Micro-Controllers and Programmable Logic Controllers
- Use Grafcet/ST to control Automatic Systems of low to medium complexity
- Understand a given "Specifications Contract" that could have been given by a customer
- Design and implement an Event Driven Automatic Control System, for problems of medium complexity
- Understand the temporal behaviour of signals involved in discrete event systems and associated time restrictions for elementary systems
